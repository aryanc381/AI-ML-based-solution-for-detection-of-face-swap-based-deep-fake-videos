## Problem Statement 1683: Development of AI/ML Based Solution for Detection of DeepFake Images and Videos of Face Swap

### Background

Synthetically-generated audios and videos, known as deepfakes, have become a prevalent trend in recent years. While these technologies have captured the imagination of the tech-savvy community, they also pose significant risks. Deepfakes can disrupt politics, commit fraud, spread misinformation, and create non-consensual content. Recently, they have been used to defame individuals by replacing their facial identities in videos.

Due to advancements in AI/ML and Generative AI, detecting deepfakes has become a challenging task for security agencies. Research is ongoing to tackle this problem, and as a use case for this problem statement, we aim to develop a forensic technique to authenticate face-swap deepfake videos.

### Detailed Description

Detecting deepfakes requires a multifaceted approach involving technology, regulation, education, and collaboration. On the technological front, several advanced algorithms and tools can be employed:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** 
   - Detect inconsistencies in facial features, expressions, and movements.
   - Analyze video frames over time to identify unnatural transitions.

2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:**
   - Analyze sequences of video frames to detect temporal anomalies indicative of deepfakes.

3. **Capsule Networks:**
   - Identify discrepancies in facial pose and texture.

4. **Adversarial Training:**
   - Use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate deepfakes and simultaneously train detection models to improve robustness.

5. **Audio-Visual Inconsistencies:**
   - Detect mismatches between lip movements and speech, or inconsistencies in ambient sounds.

6. **Blockchain Technology:**
   - Create immutable records of media to ensure authenticity and verifiable chain of custody.

7. **Frequency Analysis:**
   - Analyze frequency domains to detect anomalies and artifacts introduced during deepfake creation.

8. **Biometric Verification:**
   - Analyze subtle behavioral traits such as micro-expressions, eye, and head movements to detect anomalies.

9. **Hybrid Models:**
   - Combine spatial, temporal, audio, and frequency analysis to enhance robustness and accuracy.

### Expected Solution

The goal is to develop an AI/ML-based solution to authenticate face-swap deepfake videos. The system should be capable of analyzing a video suspected of being a deepfake and provide a detailed report on various characteristics, including:

- Confirmation of whether the video is fake.
- Details of observed abnormalities.
- Mathematical techniques underlying the creation of the deepfake.

### Features

- **Video Input:** Process suspected deepfake videos.
- **Detection Algorithms:** Utilize advanced AI/ML techniques for deepfake detection.
- **Detailed Report:** Generate a comprehensive report highlighting abnormalities and detection details.
